# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Rock/Paper/Scissors Game created during my training at Interface3 â€“ Brussels

The player clicks on one of the images to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects a hand with a visual animation. Points for each player are automatically updated.

The game continues until one of the players scores 3 points and wins the round. The winner of the round gets 1 point. The player can start a new game by clicking "Play Again" or reset the game by clicking "Reset."
